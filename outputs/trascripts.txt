[00:00:00.000 - 00:00:20.000] the total thousand and twenty four calendar is here get it now before it sells out and stay tuned to the end of this video for a sneak peek that out of this world life has existed on one planet for about four billion years as far as we know but it might have started right after the big bang when the universe was much stranger and more fantastic than today the universe that might have allowed life to develop absolutely anywhere the cosmos might be full of the seeds of life sleeping in a dead desert waiting for a few drops of rain to explosively bloom and grow tiny and
[00:00:20.000 - 00:00:40.000] not so tiny aliens might be everywhere in this video we're going to put together to highly speculative yet scientifically grounded possibilities check out the scientific papers in our sources to properly explain his let's first look at the paradox of life on earth that life paradox
[00:00:40.000 - 00:01:00.000] before it's first few hundred million years earth was a magma hell constantly bombarded by asteroids loop basically the second things calm down and the first oceans formed life just appeared and zillions of microbes settled every nook and cranny they found this is kind of strange life on earth seems to be almost as old as the planet itself as if it was waiting around for an opportunity but life didn't only appear extremely quickly in that tiny time window is also crossed a huge gap to qualify as living things even microbes need to eat poop grow and multiply to do that they need a gene
[00:01:00.000 - 00:01:20.000] oh the biological instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism how did things with no genome become living things with genomes is what is the biggest riddles of science simplify a lot the problem is that to have a functioning genome in a proteins and to make those proteins you need a functioning gino both proteins and genomes are super long molecules made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult to assemble by chance it's a chicken egg paradox with several chickens of eggs once you have a finished sell the whole system works efficiently but starting from simple dead stuff and reaching that level of sophistication
[00:01:20.000 - 00:01:40.000] and by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error so how did the first living things managed to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years most theories about the origin of life trying to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive super of pre baltic molecules could huh
[00:01:40.000 - 00:02:00.000] have officially produce the first self replicating entities but we still don't know how exactly this would have worked maybe we need to think backwards the clock of evolution think of g knows as a book telling the history of life as time passed and life evolves more characters were introduced amoeba fish amphibians dinosaurs and mammals over billions of years the story of life got more and more complex the genome can be viewed as a long string of letters with biological instructions and from microbes to us today functional genome seem to have been
[00:02:00.000 - 00:02:20.000] increasing in size a fairly constant rate the functional genome of fish is more than twice that of loves our functional genome is about toys bigger than that of fish and so on it is a bit more complicated but for now let's run with this when we put all these clues together it seems that genome have been doubling
[00:02:20.000 - 00:02:40.000] sighs on average every three hundred and fifty million years or so as if evolution had been following an exponential in a clock but it gets even stranger the very first microbes that emerged on earth even if they look simple already seem to have had pretty long and complex chinos but how could life have achieved that level of complexity in such a short time there may be an interesting way to solve this riddle we just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time to the simplest conceive all my for something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a few letters
[00:02:40.000 - 00:03:00.000] but if we do that we end up ten billion views in the past more than twice the age of earth which means if life actually evolved like this it didn't start here but somewhere out there in space this would explain why life started to thrive so quickly on our young panties
[00:03:00.000 - 00:03:20.000] if it was already present in space like a sees it just needed water and warm temperatures to wake up and go on involving and it would also explain the high degree of sophistication of the first life forms on earth they could have been complex already because they might have been evolving for billions of years somewhere else in the universe but could life really be that hold maybe yes actually life could have started shortly after the universe itself was born a goldilocks baby universe as it's most basic level life need to things the right chemical elements to form complex molecules and a liquid me
[00:03:20.000 - 00:03:40.000] medium like water in which those molecules can move and it drags the liquid medium needs to stay warm enough to remain well liquid so when we search for life in space we focus on earth like planets just the right distance from their star warm enough to sustain liquid water but there was actually a time when almost all
[00:03:40.000 - 00:04:00.000] all of the universe might have been habitable right after the big bang the universe was extremely hot but as the cosmos expanded it cooled and between about ten and seventeen million years after the big bang when the universe was a thousand times younger than today it was between one hundred degrees celsius and zero degrees celsius the temperature at which water is liquid so for this window of time more than thirteen point seven billion years ago the whole universe absolutely every inch of it had the right temperature to support life of course the right temperature alone is not enough for life we also need chemical element
[00:04:00.000 - 00:04:20.000] it's like carbon and oxygen which have forged in the cause of stars but we're their stars in super early cosmic times maybe yes it reaches of the universe where matter was especially dance such stars would have been very massive i'm gone supernova in just three million years seating the baby universe with the chemical of
[00:04:20.000 - 00:04:40.000] much needed to for dust asteroids planets and the ingredients of life maybe the first ancestors of life were more exotic and didn't even need water but thrived in substances like ammonia or a thing that can stay liquid at temperatures fall below zero degrees celsius they could have been sustained by the lingering walk through the big bang for tens of millions of years longer well into a time when we met for sure that was stars and all the chemical elements the real magic of this idea is that well the universe today is extremely deadly and hostile back then the conditions for life might have been basically everywhere for a period
[00:04:40.000 - 00:05:00.000] that may have lasted several dozen million years primordial life might have been able to emerge on any iraq even between the stars sewing the universe with the seeds of what billions of years later would become bacteria trying to bite dinosaurs and finally us at some point the of
[00:05:00.000 - 00:05:20.000] those cool down below the right temperature for life to thrive but some of those ancestral life forms may have continue to exist in the internal want to the first planets frozen an asteroid or hibernating in cosmic dust tiny seeds roaming the cosmos waiting for new hospitable places to continue evolving if they did life now might be everywhere in the universe will we ever know all this makes for a nice story and while both habitability of the baby universe and or exponential clock of life are reasonable idea is there still speculative one more possibility among many other
[00:05:20.000 - 00:05:40.000] as trying to explain our existence today but if life came to us from outer space than it should have ceded other places in the solar system to maybe there are fossils and dry riverbed so mars maybe we'll soon find life in the warm underground oceans of and senators or europa tyson has sees
[00:05:40.000 - 00:06:00.000] rivers and lakes of a thing and me thing as warm as the universe with it was ninety million years old so finding exotic life on titan that would support the idea that life could have originated in the way the baby universe so far what me look out into the cosmos we don't see anyone my costs but maybe that's because life needed ten billion years or more to reach the level of complexity that allows for technological species may be there are millions of world filled with microbes oceans full of exotic fish and continents of bizarre animals and maybe even others like us that just recently gained consciousness
[00:06:00.000 - 00:06:20.000] and are beginning to look at the sky wondering if there are love life could be flourishing right now and uncountable forms and it all kinds of cosmic environments and if many of us share a common cosmic origin we would all be part of a great cosmic family the answer may lie in our cosmic back
