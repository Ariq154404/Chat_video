00:01:00.000] the two thousand and twenty four calendar is here get it now before it sells out and stay tuned to the end of this video for a sneak peek that out of this world life has existed on one planet for about four billion years as far as we know but it might have started right after the big bang when the universe was much stranger and more fantastic than today the universe that might have allowed life to develop absolutely anywhere the cosmos might be full of the seeds of life sleeping in a dead desert waiting for a few drops of rain to explosively bloom and grow tiny and not so tiny aliens might be everywhere in this video we're going to put together to highly speculative yet scientifically grounded possibilities check out the scientific papers in our sources to properly explain his let's first look at the paradox of life on earth that life paradox\n[00:01:00.000 - 00:02:00.000] before it's first few hundred million years earth was a magma hell constantly bombarded by asteroids loop basically the second things calm down and the first oceans formed life just appeared and zillions of microbes settled every nook and cranny they found this is kind of strange life on earth seems to be almost as old as the planet itself as if it was waiting around for an opportunity but life didn't only appear extremely quickly in that tiny time window is also crossed a huge gap to qualify as living things even microbes need to eat poop grow and multiply to do that they need a gino the biological instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism how did things with no genome become living things with genomes is what is the biggest riddles of science a lot the problem is that to have a functioning genome in a proteins and to make those proteins you need a functioning gino\n[00:02:00.000 - 00:03:00.000] both proteins and genomes are super long molecules made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult to assemble by chance it's a chicken egg paradox with several chickens of eggs once you have a finished sell the whole system works efficiently but starting from simple dead stuff and reaching that level of sophistication by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error so how did the first living things managed to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years most theories about the origin of life trying to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive super of pre baltic molecules could have officially produce the first self replicating entities but we still don't know how exactly this would have worked maybe we need to think backwards the clock of evolution think of g knows as a book telling the history of life as time passed and life evolves more\n[00:03:00.000 - 00:04:00.000] characters were introduced amoeba fish amphibians dinosaurs and mammals over billions of years the story of life got more and more complex the genome can be viewed as a long string of letters with biological instructions and from microbes to us today functional genome seem to have been increasing in size a fairly constant rate the functional genome of fish is more than twice that of loves our functional genome is about toys bigger than that of fish and so on it is a bit more complicated but for now let's run with this when we put all these clues together it seems that genome have been doubling in size on average every three hundred and fifty million years or so as if evolution had been following an exponential in a clock but it gets even stranger the very first microbes that emerged on earth even if they look simple already seem to have had pretty long and complex chinos\n[00:04:00.000 - 00:05:00.000] but how could life have achieved that level of complexity in such a short time there may be an interesting way to solve this riddle we just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time to the simplest conceive all my for something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a few letters but if we do that we end up ten billion views in the past more than twice the age of earth which means if life actually evolved like this it didn't start here but somewhere out there in space this would explain why life started to thrive so quickly on our young panties if it was already present in space like a sees it just needed water and warm temperatures to wake up and go on involving and it would also explain the high degree of sophistication of the first life forms on earth they could have been complex already because they might have been evolving for billions of years somewhere else in the universe but\n[00:05:00.000 -
